# TriviaGame
Trivia Game using Javascript (e.g. timers), JQuery, HTML, and CSS

## Gameplay
A set of instructions and a "Start" button will be displayed on page load. Once the user clicks "Start", the game will begin and the first question will be displayed. The user has 30 seconds to click on an answer. If the user clicks on an answer before the time is up, a message will be displayed telling the user whether they chose the right answer or not. If the time runs out before they choose an answer, a message will be displayed saying that the user ran out of time, and the next question will be displayed. This process will continue until the last question, and the stats will be displayed at the end of the game.
